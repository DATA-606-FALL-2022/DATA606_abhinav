<h1>ALZEIMERS PREDICTION </h1>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

The degenerative neurologic illness Alzheimer's disease results in the death of brain cells and brain tissue shrinkage. The most frequent cause of dementia, which is characterized by a steady deterioration in thinking, acting, and social abilities and impairs a person's capacity for independent functioning, is Alzheimer's disease. In the United States, 5.8 million persons aged 65 and older have Alzheimer's disease. Eighty per cent of them are 75 or older. Between 60% and 70% of the estimated 50 million dementia sufferers globally are thought to have Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease causes significant memory loss, which makes it difficult for a patient to do daily duties. 

What is your issue of interest (provide sufficient background information)? 

I find myself drawn to medical issues that data science can help solve. The topic "Alzheimer's prediction" caught my attention as I searched through many issue statements such as breast cancer detection and skin cancer detection, among others. 

Why is this issue important to you and/or to others? 

Cost-effectiveness is one of the primary factors that led me to choose this project. The process of Alzheimer's diagnosis is drawn out and laborious. The patient must go through testing, which may be time-consuming and expensive. However, it will undoubtedly save money and time if an algorithm is developed that only uses the patient's medical data to forecast their likelihood of getting Alzheimer's. 

<h3>DATA</h3>

The "centres for disease control and prevention" website is where most of the dataset is sourced from. There are also datasets in dataworld website and many other websites. The dataset contains information on age, gender, socioeconomic position, educational attainment, and brain scan data. The size of the dataset is around 80MB. 
The datasets from dataworld can be downloaded and combined with the original data if more data is ever required.
I plan to implement Support Vector Classifier, KNN classifier and MLP classifier on the data. To get the highest level of accuracy, we would compare the algorithms by varying the hyperparameters.

<h3>OUTCOMES</h3>

What outcomes do you intend to achieve (better understanding of problems, tools to help solve problems, predictive analytics with practicle applications, etc)?
The goal of this project is to identify the best algorithm for quickly and cheaply diagnosing Alzheimer's. Although the concept appears straightforward, really putting it into practice is rather challenging. The procedure of diagnosing Alzheimer's in the real world will entail a number of additional variables. Therefore, even if this initiative probably won't be able to completely transform the sector, it will undoubtedly serve as a springboard for further advancements.
