The dataset is huge to be uploaded into either GitHub or google drive since it contains images. Hence I stored them in my local machine to store the data.<br>
The structure of the dataset is as follows.
The <b><i>Capstone</b></i> folder contains a Dataset folder along with the medical information datasets.

Inside the dataset, there are different folders labelled with unique MRI ids.

Inside each folder, there are 3 different folders <b><i>FSL_SEG</b></i>, <b><i>PROCESSED</b></i>, and <b><i>RAW</b></i>.

These subfolders contain different MRI images.

For this project, we are using masked images from ' the 'Dataset\OAS1_0001_MR1\PROCESSED\MPRAGE\T88_111' folder.
